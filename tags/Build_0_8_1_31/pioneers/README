Gnocatan 0.8

Gnocatan is an Internet playable implementation of the Settlers of
Catan board game.  The aim is to remain as faithful to the board game
as is possible.

Playing the Game
================

Gnocatan is a multi-player game.  Each player must run the Gnocatan
client: gnocatan.  One of the players must also run the Gnocatan
server: gnocatan-server-gtk or gnocatan-server-console.

The GTK server has a user interface in which you can customise the
game parameters.  Once you are happy with the game parameters, press
the Start Server button, and the server will start listening for
client connections.

When you start the client program, it displays a connect dialog.  You
must define the hostname and port where the server can be located.
You can enter these manually, or press the Meta Server button.  The
meta server maintains a list of all registered Gnocatan servers that
are currently running a game.  This allows you to join a game anywhere
on the Internet.

Gnocatan is most fun with three or four players, but two players is
still ok, or you can add some computer players if you like.
