      <para>
        Gnocatan is a GNOME game based upon the board game Settlers of Catan
        created by Mayfair Games. Gnocatan was originally authored by Dave
        Cole in the spring and summer of 1999. Dave wanted to be able to
        play the game without having to travel, so he developed a computer
        implementation of the game. The Gnocatan project stalled in the late
        summer of 1999 and saw little development until the early spring of
        2000 when the project was taken over by Andy Heroff and moved to
        SourceForge. Andy recruited several developers (including Dave) and
        they are now working to improve upon the original game as well as
        fix the bugs that have been found in older versions.

        <title>The robber prompt</title>

	<para>If you roll 7 on the dice, all players who are holding
	  more than 7 resources will be prompted to discard half of
	  them.  While there are still players who have to discard
	  resources, the actions panel will be replaced by a list of
	  those players.  Next to each player name is the number of
	  resources that they must discard.</para>

        <title>The place robber prompt</title>

	<para>After all excess resources have been discarded, if you
	  were the player who rolled 7 on the dice, you must place the
	  robber on the map.  The actions panel is replaced by a
	  prompt to that effect.</para>
	
	<para>When you play a soldier development card, you must place

	development cards that you are currently holding are displayed
	in this list.  Note that any cards in this list are not yet in

      </figure>

      <para>Gnocatan is played on a map which is built up from a grid
        of terrain hexes.  Each hex on the map has a terrain type
        which defines the resources, if any, that are produced by that
        hex.</para>

      <para>Settlements and cities are built on the corners of land
        hexes, while roads are built along the edges of land
        hexes.</para>

      <para>In the centre of resource producing hexes, there is a
        circle containing a number.  At the start of each turn, two
        dice are rolled, all hexes that are labelled with a number
        equalling the sum of the two dice will produce resources for
        buildings on that hex.  Underneath the number in the circle
        are a some dots.  The number of dots is equal to the number of
        different dice combinations that will generate this number.
        To highlight the two most commonly rolled numbers, the 6 and 8
        are displayed in red (there is no label with the number 7).
        In addition, the hexes that produced resources this turn are
        painted with a green background.</para>

      <para>The sea hexes which have a circle in them have building
        sites for ports where maritime trading can be performed.  The
        location of the building sites is indicated by a dashed line
        drawn from the circle to a hex corner.  The letter in the
        circle indicates the resource type which may be traded at the
        ports.  The question mark label indicates that all resource
        types can be traded at the associated port locations.</para>

      <para>The black bottle shape is the robber.</para>

      <para>The following table shows each terrain type, the resources
        produced by that terrain, and the port indicator for the
        resource.</para>

	  the number in the hex, all buildings on the corners of that
	  hex will collect resources of the type generated by that
	  hex.</para>

	<para>Settlements collect one resource, and cities receive two
	  resources.  If a player has multiple buildings on a hex,
	  each of those buildings will collect resources.</para>

	<para>The hex containing the robber never generates
	  resources.</para>

	<para>If you roll 7 on the dice, all players with excess
	  resources must discard them, then you must move the

	<para>The robber begins the game in the desert, but can never
	  be moved back into the desert.</para>

	<para>If you roll 7 on the dice, you must move the robber to a
	  new location on the map.</para>

	<para>Whenever you play a soldier development card, you must

	<para>Once you have moved the robber to a new hex, the robber
	  will steal a random resource from another player who has a
	  building on that hex.  If there are multiple potential
	  victims for the robber, you will need to choose the victim
	  by selecting one of the buildings on the hex.  When the
	  robber steals the resource, only the players involved in the
	  transaction will be told which resource was stolen.</para>
