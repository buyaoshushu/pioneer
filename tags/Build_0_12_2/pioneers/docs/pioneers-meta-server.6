.TH pioneers-meta-server 6 "May 9, 2006" "pioneers"
.SH NAME
pioneers-meta-server \- meta game server for Pioneers

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pioneers-meta-server
.RI [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Pioneers
is an implementation of the popular, award-winning "Settlers of Catan"
board game.  It uses a client/server model for networked play. This program
provides a piece of network infrastructure that helps match pioneers clients to
pioneers servers. Casual players of pioneers probably do not need to run this
program.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-h
Print a short help text and exit.

.TP
.B \-d
Run in daemon mode.

.TP
.BI \-r " location"
.RI "Redirect to " location "."

.TP
.BI \-s " hostname"
.RI "Use " hostname " as hostname when creating servers."

.TP
.BI \-p " from" \- "to"
.RI "Use ports in the range " from "-" to " (inclusive) for started servers."
It is advised not to include port 5555 in the range.  (See BUGS below.)
When this range is not specified, the meta-server will not be able to create
new games.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The default settings of the meta-server can be influenced with the
following three environment variables:
.TP 
.B PIONEERS_META_SERVER
The hostname the meta-server will use when creating new games. This should
be a hostname that can be resolved by all clients that will connect.
.TP 
.B PIONEERS_SERVER_CONSOLE
.RB "The path to " pioneers-server-console "."
If it is not set, the default installation path will be used.
.TP
.B PIONEERS_DIR
The path to the game definition files.
If it is not set, the default installation path will be used.

.SH FILES
.B /usr/share/games/pioneers/*.game
.RS
Game definitions
.RE

.SH BUGS
.I pioneers-server-console
uses port 5555 for its admin connection.  This means that only the first server
started from the meta-server will actually succeed in binding to that.  For all
subsequent servers, the admin socket fails to open, and thus cannot be
connected to.
