Gnocatan 0.5.5

Gnocatan is an Internet playable implementation of the Settlers of
Catan board game.  The aim is to remain as faithful to the board game
as is possible.

Playing the Game
================

Gnocatan is a multi-player game.  Each player must run the Gnocatan
client; gnocatan.  One of the players must also run the Gnocatan
server; gnocatan-server.

The server has a user interface in which you can customise the game
parameters.  Customisation is fairly limited at the moment, but this
should change in later versions.  Once you are happy with the game
parameters, press the Start Server button, and the server will start
listening for client connections.

When you start the client program, it displays a connect dialog.  You
must define the hostname and port where the server can be located.
You can enter these manually, or press the Meta Server button.  The
meta server maintains a list of all registered Gnocatan servers that
are currently running a game.  This allows you to join a game anywhere
on the Internet.

The current version of Gnocatan works best with three or four players,
but two players is still a fun game.
