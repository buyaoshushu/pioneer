Gnocatan

Gnocatan is an Internet playable implementation of the Settlers of
Catan board game.  The aim is to remain as faithful to the board game
as is possible.

Playing the Game
================

Gnocatan is a multi-player game.  Each player must run the Gnocatan
client: gnocatan.  One of the players must also run the Gnocatan
server: gnocatan-server-gtk or gnocatan-server-console.

The GTK server has a user interface in which you can customise the
game parameters.  Once you are happy with the game parameters, press
the Start Server button, and the server will start listening for
client connections.

When you start the client program, it displays a connect dialog.  You
must define the hostname and port where the server can be located.
You can enter these manually, or press the Meta Server button.  The
meta server maintains a list of all registered Gnocatan servers that
are currently running a game.  This allows you to join a game anywhere
on the Internet.

Gnocatan is most fun with three or four players, but two players is
still ok, or you can add some computer players if you like.

Simple install procedure
========================

  % tar xvzf gnocatan-<version>.tar.gz	# unpack the sources
  % cd gnocatan				# change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure				# regenerate configure and run it
  % make				# build Gnocatan
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install			# install Gnocatan

Building RPM Binary Packages
============================
This section is intended to make it easier for those people that wish to
build RPMs from the source included in this package, but aren't sure how.

1) Copy gnocatan-<version>.tar.gz to your RPM SOURCES directory. Usually
   this is /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/.

2) Extract or copy gnocatan.spec into your RPM SPECS directory. Usually
   this is /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/.

3) In your RPM SPECS directory, issue the command 'rpm -ba gnocatan.spec'.
   This will cause rpm to extract the gnocatan sources to a temporary
   directory, build them, and build rpm packages based on the information in
   the spec file. The binary rpms will be put into your RPM RPMS directory.
   Usually this is /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<platform>/.

If you have any further questions, please refer to the RPM documentation.

Building Debian Binary Packages
===============================
This section is intended to make it easier for those people that wish to
build Debian binary packages (.deb's) from the source included in this
package, but aren't sure how.

1) Extract gnocatan-<version>.tar.gz inside a temporary directory. The
   Debian binaries will be placed in this directory. A directory named
   gnocatan-<version> will be created when you extract the archive.

2) Change into the gnocatan-<version> directory.

3) Issue the command dpkg-buildpackage (You must have dpkg-dev installed in
   order to issue this command). This will configure and build the Debian
   binaries, placing them in the parent directory of your current directory.

If you have any further questions, please refer to the Debian dpkg
documentation.
