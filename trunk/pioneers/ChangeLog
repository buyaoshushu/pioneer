1999-12-22  Dan Egnor <egnor@ofb.net>

	* server/STATES: Attempt at documenting the server state machine.

        * server/trade.c: Fixed? a possible trade race condition.  Actually, 
	the fix was already there, I just think it wasn't quite right, since 
	it didn't reset the player's state properly.  This should be reviewed.

	* server/5-6-player.game: New game file for 5/6 player expansion 
	(from tlau@cs.washington.edu).

	* client/turn.c, server/trade.c: Implemented option to remove 
	build/trade order restriction, as per 5/6 player expansion rules 
	(from tlau@cs.washington.edu).

	* server/gnocatan-server.c, meta-server/gnocatan-meta-server.c:
	Portability fixes (e.g. for Solaris).

	* client/Makefile.am, meta-server/Makefile.am, server/Makefile.am:
	Removed silly setgid "games" from install target.

	* client/help/C/gnocatan.sgml: Fixed some errors in the SGML help-file 
	source.  (Too bad this help file is getting out of date anyway...)

	* macros/Makefile.in: removed from CVS, since it's generated.

1999-12-16  Dan Egnor <egnor@ofb.net>

	* Fixed bug which prevented anyone who didn't build a ship during setup
	from building a ship later (the check to see if the user was out of ships
	was incorrect).

	* "make dist" works now, and has the right version number.

	* Fixed bug #2 (the "domestic-trade delete" bug).

	* Added .cvsignore files to kill those pesky ?'s.

        * client/player.c: Beep when it's your turn.  Is this a good idea?
	I know I'm often distracted and don't notice when my turn comes up.
	It should probably be an option, but I hate to get into the business
	of having "gnocatan preferences"...

	* server/gnocatan-server.c: Fix some problems with the terrain
	randomization toggle; clean up (?) the UI enable/disable logic some
	(the UI is now fully disabled when you start a game).

	* server/seafarers.game: Added chit placement numbers to the tiles.
	Without this, there are no chits, which makes this map a little less
	useful.  I'm pretty sure the numbers aren't in the right places
	(there are lots of neighboring 8's and such); I'll get out our copy 
	of Seafarers and do the right thing at some point.  At least this way 
	we can start testing. 

	* server/server.c: setsockopt(SO_REUSEADDR) *before* bind().

1999-12-16  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>

	* client/gui.c: Added gui_set_game_params() to notify gui code
	when map is available, and to pass game parameters.  Hide toolbar
	buttons that are not used in the game.

	* client/identity.c: Do not display shapes that are not used in
	the game.
	
1999-11-20  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>
	* client/guimap.c: Replaced all of the bogus hand building of
	ships, roads, settlements and cities with a single shape for each
	which is scaled and rotated as required.

	* client/chat.c: Small code reformat.
	
1999-09-04  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>
	* gnocatan.spec, debian/gnocatan-server.files,
	server/Makefile.am, server/small.game: Added small.game.

	* server/gnocatan-server.c (build_interface): Call
	load_game_types() to after creating all widgets.

	* client/trade.c, common/game.c, common/game.h,
	server/default.game, seafarers.game, server/trade.c,
	server/turn.c: Added domestic_trade flag to allow domestic trading
	to be disabled for in a game.  When disabled, the domestic trading
	GUI is not shown.

	* server/robber.c (mode_place_robber): Fixed core dump in games
	where the robber is not initially displayed (small.game).

	* client/client.c, client/client.h, client/develop.c: Dynamically
	allocate the development card deck when the game parameters have
	been received from the server.  Fixes bug where
	DevelDeck.max_cards was not being initialised for player.

	* server/develop.c, server/player.c, server/server.h: Dynamically
	allocate the development card deck for each player when allocated.
	Fixes bug where DevelDeck.max_cards was not being initialised for
	player.
	
1999-09-03  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>
	* common/game.[ch]: Added params_copy() to create an independant
	copy of a GameParams structure.

	server/server.h, server/trade.c, server/turn.c: Changed
	game->params into a pointer to a copy of the GameParams loaded
	from the game file.  This enables the map to be reinitialised
	properly on game restart.  Removed unused game->map and use
	game->params->map instead.

	* common/map.c (layout_chits): Fixed bug which assumed that the
	number of terrain hexes equaled the number of chits in the layout
	sequence.

	* README: Updated version number to 0.4.0

	* gnocatan.spec, client/Makefile.am, server/Makefile.am,

	client/setup.c, common/buildrec.c, common/map_query.c,
	server/buildutil.c, server/pregame.c, server/robber.c,
	server/turn.c, common/game.h, common/map.h, server/server.h:
	Removed EdgeType and Building enums, expanded BuildType enum to
	describe all types of building.  Renamed Node.building to
	Node.type to be consistent with Edge.type.

	* client/guimap.c: Deleted find_ship(), build_ship_regions() as
	they were identical to find_road(), build_road_regions().  Renamed
	find_road(), build_road_regions() to find_edge(),
	build_edge_regions().

	* common/Makefile.am: Added game.c.

	* common/buildrec.c (ship_has_place_for_settlement): Added check
	is_node_on_land().  Fixed formatting of a lot of code.

	* common/buildrec.h, common/map.h: Moved enum BuildType, enum
	Terrain, enum Resources to common/map.h

	* common/game.h: Removed NUM_DEVELOP.  Expanded GameParams to make
	all previously static game parameters dynamic.  Added params_*()
	functions to encapsulate GameParams loading / saving / parsing.
	
	* server/develop.c, server/server.h: Replaced static description
	of development card deck with dynamic description from
	game_params.

	* common/map.[ch]: Removed static chat_values[] chit layout
	sequence and replaced it with dynamically defined sequence in
	GameParams.  Added map_set_chits() to bind a chit sequence to a
	map.

	* server/buildutil.c, server/player.c, server/turn.c: Made
	player->num_* count the number of each type that the player has
	built, instead of store the number of each type the player has
	left to build.

	* server/gnocatan-server.c: Almost completely reworked GUI
	handling code.

	* server/pregame.c: Removed send_game_map() as this task is now

1999-06-29  JT <jtraub@dragoncat.net>
	* server/*.c: Made sure the server reset features were correct.

1999-06-16  JT <jtraub@dragoncat.net>

	* server/server.c (close_player): Fixed bug where server was
	reporting to the meta-server, players leaving the game who had
	never joined it.  It was possible to make the meta-server report
	-ve player counts.
	
1999-06-08  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>

	* Released 0.3.3

	domestic trade list.
	
	* client/guimap.[ch] (load_pixmap): Made function global and added

	* client/player.c (player_set_name): When changing player name,

	* client/quote.c (quote_finish): Do not clear quote_list, as we
	need to be able to interpret quotes accepted even after we have
	rejected domestic trade.

	* client/quote.c (add_reject_row, remove_reject_rows): Pasted
	these functions from trade.c.  Should clean up trading code for
	0.4.x.

	player rejected trade row to indicate that other players are
	rejecting domestic trade.

	* client/quote.c (quote_trade_accept): Monitor domestic trade
	activity even after we have rejected trade.  This allows us to
	maintain correct resource counts in the player summary.

	check_domestic_trades, trade_domestic_quote): Added pixmaps for
	tick and cross to indicate validity of each quote from other
