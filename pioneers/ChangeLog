2003-07-19  Bas Wijnen  <b.wijnen@phys.rug.nl>

	* ai/greedy.c: Fixed ai building bug 772865
	
	* server/gnocatan-server-gtk.c, server/meta.c, server/server.h:
	Added "Send hostname" for metaserver to allow masqueraded hosts to
	show correctly (they need a forwarded port).

	* server/player.c, server/pregame.c: Fixed bug 770314.

	* common/map_query.c: New longest road algorithm, fixes bugs
	  #762927 and #774107.

2003-07-04  Bas Wijnen  <b.wijnen@phys.rug.nl>

	* client/gui.c: Added hotkey support for standard actions

2003-05-31  Jeff Breidenbach  <jab@debian.org>

	* Security fixes courtesy of Bas Wijnen

2003-02-21  Jeff Breidenbach  <jab@debian.org>

	* debian/rules: Adjusted .deb build rules to Steve's suggestion.
	  Allows debuild to run from pristine CVS checkout while still
	  allowing debian/ tweakers to avoid some build latency.

2003-02-14  Andy Heroff  <aheroff@ameritech.net>

	* server/player.c: Fixed several GList usage issues in player
	  reconnection code. Need to always store the return value from
	  an append or remove, also don't need to allocate a list node
	  when the GList pointer is NULL. NULL is considered the empty
	  list value.

	* server/turn.c: Check for NULL player when trying to hand out
	  resources after a roll. We can run into this if a player drops
	  and a roll occurs while he is disconnected. Fixes bug 621358,
	  but creates bug 686956.

2003-02-13  Andy Heroff  <aheroff@ameritech.net>

	* Batch fix of bugs 205475, 480328, 482336, 482744. Cleaned up
	  compiler warnings.

	* ai/ai.c: Removed goto. Added warning when the computer names file
	  can't be found.

	* server/gnocatan-server-console.c: Added printing of usage
	  information if attempt to start server returns FALSE.

	* server/gnocatan-server.c: Added missing CR to log message. Changed
	  g_error call to g_critical call when game params are not found to
	  prevent server from exiting at that point, also allowing the call
	  to return FALSE in that case.

2003-02-11  Andy Heroff  <aheroff@ameritech.net>

	* server/trade.c: Fixed SF bug 660814 regarding server crash during
	  trading. Wrong quote list nodes were being deleted when a new
	  quote was issued which removed a request for a resource for which
	  there was already a quote on the table.

2003-01-24  Steve Langasek  <vorlon@debian.org>

	* client/settingscreen.c, po/gnocatan.pot, po/de.po: fix misspelling.

	* po/es.po: translation improvements.  Although only 60% of the
	  gettext strings are translated, the game is now almost
	  completely playable in Spanish.

	* debian/rules: tweak Debian build script so that we can skip
	  certain developer-only tasks, and so we don't end up with an
	  extra changelog in the directory.

2003-01-23  Steve Langasek  <vorlon@debian.org>

	* client/connect.c, common/meta.h: automatically upgrade the
	  metaserver setting to one that works if the old metaserver is
	  saved in the client settings.

2003-01-21  Steve Langasek  <vorlon@debian.org>

	* client/client.h, client/resource.c, client/monopoly.c,
	  client/player.c: use caller-provided buffer for
	  resource_cards(), to eliminate the previous kludge :)

2003-01-21  Roman Hodek  <roman@hodek.net>

	* po/de.po: Fixed a few German translations after Steves changes
	below.

	* client/resource.c (resource_cards): let it use two alternating
	static buffers, because this function is sometimes called twice as
	function argument.

2003-01-21  Steve Langasek  <vorlon@debian.org>
	* client/client.c, client/client.h, client/player.c,
	  client/resource.c, client/trade.c: extensive reworking of
	  string handling for better i18n support.  The code still needs
	  some work to not depend on English-style plural rules, but the
	  game should now be sanely translatable to a wide range of
	  languages.

	* po/de.po, po/es.po, po/gnocatan.pot: update the Spanish and
	  German translations in accordance with the above.

2003-01-19  Roman Hodek  <roman@hodek.net>

	* po/gnocatan.pot: rebuilt

	* po/de.po, po/es.po: updated from new .pot; de is fixed already
	(not many changes...), es still needs more translations
	
	* ai/greedy.c: AI chat spelling fixes by Tril <tril@tunes.org>

	* client/trade.c (is_domestic_trade_allowed): patch by Tril
	<tril@tunes.org>: allow trade even if nobody has the resource in
	question, in case somebody wants to give away for free :)

	* gnocatan.spec: applied patch by Daniel Jensen
	<jensend@iname.com>, adding manpages and fixing images (release 3)

2003-01-16  Steve Langasek  <vorlon@debian.org>
	* common/meta.h, meta-server/meta-report: change to using
	  gnocatan.debian.net as the default metaserver instead of
	  the defunct term1.dccs.com.au.

2003-01-15  Jeff Breidenbach  <jab@debian.org>

	* themes.c: incorporate string terminator patch from Hal Eisen

2003-01-15  Steve Langasek  <vorlon@debian.org>
	* gnocatan.spec: RPM packaging updates from Daniel Jensen

2003-01-14  Steve Langasek  <vorlon@debian.org>
	* client/Makefile.am: add an explicit dependency on authors.h to
	  make sure it's generated when we need it.

	* AUTHORS: adjust my email

2003-01-12  Steve Langasek  <vorlon@debian.org>

	  ai/resource.c, client/chat.c, client/client.c,
	  client/develop.c, client/player.c, client/resource.c,
	  client/settingscreen.c, po/de.po, po/es.po, po/gnocatan.pot:
	  Gettext enhancements: don't construct strings by
	  concatenation, don't mark strings for translation with _N()
	  that are non-translatable (such as '%s').
	  Add Spanish to the list of supported languages and begin
	  localizing.
	  Revert accidental breakage of the de.po file.

	* server/Makefile.am, server/gnocatan-server-gtk.c:
	  fix the directory lookup for game themes

2003-01-10  Steve Langasek  <vorlon@debian.org>
	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/gnocatan.6, docs/gnocatan-server-gtk.6,
	  docs/gnocatan-server-console.6, Makefile.am, configure.in,
	  docs/.cvsignore, debian/gnocatan-server-console.files,
	  debian/gnocatan-server-gtk.files, debian/rules: add 
	  preliminary manpages.	  

	* debian/gnocatan-server-console.undocumented, 
	  debian/gnocatan-server-gtk.undocumented,
	  debian/gnocatan-client.undocumented:
	  Not undocumented anymore.

2003-01-09  Steve Langasek  <vorlon@debian.org>
	* AUTHORS, client/Makefile.am, client/gui.c, po/gnocatan.pot,
	  po/de.po: bring the AUTHORS file up-to-date, and autogenerate
	  the about box list from this file.	  

	* client/Makefile.am: s/pixmap_DATA/image_DATA/, to please
	  automake.

2003-01-08  Steve Langasek  <vorlon@debian.org>

	* client/theme.c: use a more portable variadic macro
	  syntax, to address OS X concerns

	* server/gnocatan-server.desktop, server/Makefile.am: add a
	  GNOME desktop entry for the GTK server, so it's easier to
	  start from the menu.

	* ai/Makefile.am, client/Makefile.am, common/gnocatan-path.h.in,
	  server/Makefile.am, debian/dirs, debian/gnocatan-ai.files,
	  debian/gnocatan-server-data.files, debian/rules, gnocatan.spec,
	  server/gnocatan-server.c: move /usr/share/gnocatan to
	  /usr/share/games/gnocatan, per the FHS; move
	  things-that-are-not-pixmaps out of /usr/share/pixmaps.

2003-01-01  Jeff Breidenbach  <jab@debian.org>

	* client/Makefile.am (install-data-hook): fix silly thinko.

2002-07-21  Roman Hodek  <roman@hodek.net>

	instead. (I finally found out how to do this :)

2002-05-22  Roman Hodek  <roman@hodek.net>

	* client/gui.c: new option to show legend as a page besides the

	* debian/gnocatan-meta-server.conffiles: init.d files is a conffile

	Tobias Jakobs.
	
	* client/gui.c (help_about_cb): collected more names from
	the ChangeLog and added them to the about box.

	* client/histogram.c: paint chips as x axis labelling like on map;
	probability is a triangle rather Gaussian!! fix drawing.

	* client/guimap.c (display_hex): separate out drawing of dice chip
	into draw_dice_roll (needed by histogram also now).

	* ai/client.c (global_filter): if net connection was close, print
	message and exit.
	
	* client/client.c (global_filter): likewise, but set status to
	offline.

	* client/histogram.c: added y axis labelling, draw normal
	distribution

	* server/server.c (new_computer_player): close inherited fd's, use
	_exit normally to avoid GTK atexit procedures running.

	started closely together choose the same name.

	* server/player.c: made tournament mode work;
	Added PB_SILENT mode for player_broadcast.

	* server/server.c (new_computer_player): new argument 'server'

	zombies

	* server/gnocatan-server-console.c: new -c option to start a
	number of computer players

	* meta-server/gnocatan-meta-server.c (client_create_new_server):

	scheme as for Debian, but untested
	
	* debian/control: added Recommends: gnocatan-ai to both server
	packages, as they can start ai clients

2002-05-16  Roman Hodek  <roman@hodek.net>

	separate Arch: all package
	- split -server into -server-gtk, -server-console (much less
	dependencies!), and -server-data (common stuff)
	- new -meta-server and -ai packages
	A few debian/rules cleanups.

2002-05-13  Roman Hodek  <roman@hodek.net>

	* ai/ai.c: use gnocatan-path.h

	* server/player.c (check_versions): ignore rightmost number (after

	defaults: request=client, server=$GNOCATAN_META_SERVER, protocol=1.0

	* meta-server/Makefile.am: also include from common/

	* common/network.c:
	(write_ready, net_write): protect against closed sessions.
	PF_UNSPEC cleaner than AF_UNSPEC.
	Undefine LOG.

	* configure.in: introduce META_PROTOCOL_VERSION,
	  bump version to 0.6.99 (beta for 0.7.0)
	
	* acconfig.h: added META_PROTOCOL_VERSION

2002-05-06  Roman Hodek  <roman@hodek.net>

	* ai/greedy.c, ai/client.h: Fix "no prototype for foobar" warnings
	by introducing some statics and a new prototype.

	* Merged in latest Debian version (0.6.1-6), including:
	   - IPv6 support by using getaddrinfo()
	   - my connect dialog changes that add a new field for naming the
	     meta server to contact

	* Added new games in server/, contributed by <piman@sacredchao.net>:
	  canyon.game conquest.game  pond.game square.game star.game x.game
          And one extended by me to have ports:
	  conquest+ports.game 
	
2002-03-10  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* clean up the SGML handling so that it matches the behavior of 
	  the Debian tools (which everyone seems to be using).

2002-03-10  Andy Heroff <aheroff@ameritech.net>

	* Modified call to execv, as per SF bug 482743.

2002-03-10  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* Begin cleaning up the source to make it usable again.
	* Bump the protocol version, since, well, that's what you're 
	  supposed to do when you change the bloody protocol.

2001-05-29  David Fallon <davef@tetsubo.com>

	* Added Geoff Hanson's <gwhizz@usa.net> reconnect patch. The short version
		of how this works is when someone disconnects, instead of the usual
		cleanup, player_archive is called which saves the names of the
		disconnected individuals. On all connects, the player name is
		searched for to see if this is a player that has been archived,
		and if so, the player_revive function is called to bring them back.
		There's also a new gameinfo struct that is used to pass the game
		state back to the client. Note, if we ever have a gnocatan
		tournament, we'll have some security problems, but that's okay as
		there's no other security anyways. 
	* Changed client/build.c, client.c, client.h, develop.c, player.c, player.h
	* Changed server/develop.c, discard.c, player.c, pregame.c, robber.c,
		server.h, trade.c, turn.c

2001-03-09  Matt Waggoner  <matt@waggoner.com>

	* One of the official rule variants for Settlers of Catan is
	to disallow rolling a 7 on the first two rounds.  This has been
	added as a feature of gnocatan, as well as an additional variant:
	always reroll 7s.  These are accessed from the console server
	with the "-R n" parameter (n = 0 is normal, n = 1 is no 7s on first
	2 turns, and n = 2 is reroll all 7s), and via radio buttons in
	the GTK+ server.

2001-03-06  Matt Waggoner  <matt@waggoner.com>

	* Changed some more chat text colors; added a color for the
	beep message.

2001-03-03  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>

	* client/client.c: Fixed bad explanation in comment.

2001-03-02  Matt Waggoner  <matt@waggoner.com>

	* client/connect.c: fixed a minor bug with the server MRU list.

2001-03-01  Matt Waggoner  <matt@waggoner.com>

	* client/connect.c and client/client.c: Changed the server MRU
	list so that it also handles the user name, not just the server
	and port values.

2001-03-01  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>

	* common/state.c (sm_vnformat): Caught a segfault which appeared
	to be a buffer overrun in sm_vnformat().  Added code to actaully
	limit formatting to buffer length and abort if overrun to allow
	real bug to be found.

2001-02-28  David Falllon  <davef@getacard.com>

	* Changed client/client.h, client/gui.h, client/gnocatan.c
		to fix misc. compiler warnings. :) It offended my sensibilities.

2001-02-28  Matt Waggoner  <matt@waggoner.com>

	* Changed client/connect.c and client/client.c to add a "Recent
		Servers" drop-box to the connection dialog.  It saves the last
		100 servers connected to, moving the most recently used one
		to the top of the list.  There's not currently any way to
		delete an entry from the list, but you can manually edit your
		~/.gnome/gnocatan file if you feel so inclined.  Only servers
		that you actually successfully connect to, will be added to
		the MRU list.
		
2001-02-27  Matt Waggoner  <matt@waggoner.com>

	* Changed client/gui.c to have the Game > Settings dialog box
		include an option regarding whether or not each user's chat
		text appears in their text color.  Added a global config var
		to client/gui.h and appropriate checking code to client/chat.c.

2001-02-23  Matt Waggoner  <matt@waggoner.com>

	* Changed client/chat.c to intercept chat text that begins with a
		slash.  This could be the start of a general-purpose slash-command
		syntax.  The only command that is intercepted now is /beep NAME,
		where NAME is a name of one of the players in the game.  If you are
		the player whose name is NAME, a beep sound is generated; otherwise,
		it is ignored.  The purpose of this command is for players to be 
		able to get someone's attention.
	* Changed client/histogram.c to include number of times each value
		was rolled, percentage of the time each value was rolled, and
		text labels along the left side.

2001-02-22  David Fallon  <davef@tetsubo.com>

	* Added walrusmonkey's port background patch. (SF Patch #103768)
		I like this patch... One change might be to make the port icons
		a little larger, but all in all, the more I use it, the more I
		prefer it over the old tiles.

	* client/guimap.c: Changes how the port background rendering works. I
		changed the radius from 13 to 15 and the x/y offsets to make the
		circle a bit bigger (so the "type" is easier to figure out) and
		the 2:1/3:1 be centered. (in addition to the raw patch)

2001-02-22  Matt Waggoner  <matt@waggoner.com>

	* Added a chat window message when someone wins.
		In shiny purple!

2001-02-16  David Fallon  <davef@tetsubo.com>

	* Added Jeff Breidenbach's <jeff@alum.mit.edu> histogram patch.
		(SF Patch # 103459, 103460, 103461)

	* client/Makefile.am: Added histogram.[ch] to sources
	* client/histogram.c: Added the file - it handles the dice recording
		and the actual histogram dialog generation
	* client/histogram.h: Added the file - heade file for histogram.c
	* client/gui.c - Added help_histogram_cb function, added "Dice Histogram"
		menu option to the Help menu.
	* client/turn.c - Added call to "dice_histogram" function to record
		dice rolls for the histogram generation.

2001-02-16  Matt Waggoner  <matt@waggoner.com>

	* A whole bunch of changes to various files, implementing
		multiple message colors (i.e. resource gain messages are
		now blue), chat messages are in the player's color,
		a timestamp before each message in the window, and the
		player summary box has each line in a different color
		now!  

		Also note that because SourceForge is broken at the moment,
		I was not able to make these commits using my regular account
		(dirtside), which is why they show up under dfallon.
		
		List of files changed:
	* common/log.h: added several new MSG_* defines and a global
		log_timestamp variable
	* common/log.c: added a timestamp to each log message
	* common/common_gtk.c: added many new colors and associated
		those colors with the new MSG types defined in log.h
	* client/develop.c: changed several MSG_INFO to MSG_DEVCARD
	* client/player.h: changed the definition of the statistics struct
		to contain a pointer to a GdkColor object
	* client/player.c: added several new color types, associated those
		colors with items in the statistics array, made the statistic
		update function use the colors, and also changed many many
		MSG_INFO messages to various other MSG types
	* client/resource.c: changed MSG_INFO to MSG_RESOURCE
	* client/turn.c: changed MSG_INFO to MSG_DICE

2001-02-16  David Fallon  <davef@tetsubo.com>

	* client/build.c: Fixed SF Bug #108981

2000-09-03  Jeff Breidenbach  <jeff@alum.mit.edu>

	* debian/gnocatan-server.menu: Fix Debian bug #70831

2000-09-18  Andy Heroff  <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* server/5-6-player.game: Set default number of players to 5.

	* server/buildutil.c: Fixed bug where any edge build (road, ship
	  bridge) would count against total number of roads.

2000-09-03  Jeff Breidenbach  <jeff@alum.mit.edu>

	* debian/copyright: Added link to Gnocatan website

2000-08-26  Andy Heroff  <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* Version 0.6.1 released!

	* configure.in: Version update to 0.6.1.

	* server/develop.c: In Road Building dev card code, modified code
	  so that when RB is complete, edges build during process are
	  removed from the build list. Affects ability to trade.

	* server/trade.c: In domestic trade code, added check for valid
	  trade conditions (No trade before the roll, and if strict trade is
	  active, no trade after building or buying a dev card).

	* client/help/C/gnocatan.sgml: Started to update help code. This is
	  by no means a finished product.

2000-08-25  Jeff Breidenbach  <jeff@alum.mit.edu>

	* debian/control, debian/changelog: preparation for point release

2000-08-24  Daniel Kobras <kobras@tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de>

	* configure.in: Fix handling of 'PROTOCOL_VERSION' so it shows
	up as a string in config.h, not as an int.

2000-08-21  Andy Heroff <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* client/settingscreen.c: Modified justifications. Added i8n calls
	  to all text.

2000-08-21  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* server/player.c, client/client.c, acconfig.h, configure.in:
	Use a distinct protocol version number for client-server
	negotiation, so that versions of the client and server that behave
	compatibly will be able to connect to one another.

2000-08-18  Andy Heroff <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* client/settingscreen.c, client/gui.c, client/client.h,
	  client/Makefile.am: Added file. Added game settings screen.

2000-08-06  Jeff Breidenbach <jeff@alum.mit.edu>

	* debian/control: Tweak build dependencies (Debian bug #68516)

2000-08-01  Andy Heroff  <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* client/gui.c: Quick change to VP target text to make less
	  ambiguous.

	* server/turn.c: Added debug for 'too-many' error. In the future,
	  all errors should be unique in some way (An identifier after the
	  description) so we can track the source of bugs.

2000-07-31  Andy Heroff  <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* client/gui.c: Fixed resize bug once and for all. Added VP target
	  listing in the status bar.

2000-07-30  Jeff Breidenbach  <jeff@alum.mit.edu>

	* debian/rules: Explicitly clean client/help/C/gnocatan to
	fix Debian bug #67287 (problem with the debian build of
	gnocatan-help). This is a non-beautiful solution.

2000-07-19  Bibek Sahu  <scorpio@dodds.net>

	* client/client.c, client/config-gnome.c, client/config-gnome.h,
	  client/connect.c, client/gnocatan.c, client/gui.c: Abstracted
	  getting/setting configuration values to be platform-agnostic. 
	  Still based on gnome-config, though; perhaps we want to stratify
	  the 'config path' into its various components?

2000-07-17  Andy Heroff  <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* server/turn.c, server/develop.c, server/server.h: Fixed bug in
	  which the server would not check for a player victory after a
	  road building card had been played.

2000-07-09  Jeff Breidenbach  <jeff@alum.mit.edu>

	* debian/control: First pass at Build-Depends: field. (presumably
	useful for the Debian autobuilders.)

2000-07-08  Andy Heroff  <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* client/gui.c: Changed notebook tabs from left to top to fix the
	  client resizing bug seen going in and out of trade.

2000-06-23  Jeff Breidenbach  <jeff@alum.mit.edu>

	* debian/README.debian: removed as recommended by
	http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/ch-dother.html#s-readme

2000-06-21  Andy Heroff <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* server/player.c: Fixed a bug where a player with an older client
	  that doesn't report its version would have a player number of 0.

2000-06-19  Jeff Breidenbach  <jeff@alum.mit.edu>

	* debian/control, debian/changelog: update maintainer name,
	version numbers for debian packages.

2000-06-19  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>

	* client/connect.c (connect_create_dlg): Removed code which forced
	uppercase first character on gnome config player name.
	
2000-06-18  Andy Heroff <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* Version 0.6.0 released for general consumption!

	* client/player.c: Added a couple clauses for BUILD_BRIDGE to remove
	  compile time warnings.

2000-06-18  Bibek Sahu <scorpio@dodds.net>

	* configure.in, client/Makefile.am, client/gui.c: Made network
	  administration code optional in client.

	* server/gnocatan-server.[ch]: Code cleanups to remove warnings. 
	  Also changed some comments in gnocatan-server.h to make section
	  breaks stand out more.

2000-06-18  Andy Heroff <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* debian/control, debian/rules, debian/gnocatan-server.undocumented,
	  debian/gnocatan-client.undocumented: Applied patches submitted by
	  Jeff Breidenbach to bring Debian build files up to compliance for
	  submission to the Debian release group. We're going to be a part
	  of the official distro! Yay!

	* server/STATES, server/player.c, server/server.h, client/client.c:
	  Added version checking to the connect sequence. Also added
	  connection error messages.

2000-06-15  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* gnocatan.spec: cleaned up RedHat build to not include files twice.

2000-06-15  Andy Heroff <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* Bumped version again to 0.5.6, just in case, to prepare for
	  another package release, mostly to get Gnocatan in the Debian
	  distro.

2000-06-12  Andy Heroff <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* debian/gnocatan-server.files: Applied patch from Aaron Denney
	  that fixes build problems with the Debian packages.

2000-06-08  Bibek Sahu <scorpio@dodds.net>

	* common/network.c: changed net_write() to queue data on in-progress
	connections.  The queueing logic was already there; just fixed that
	bit of logic.

	* client/admin-gtk.c: made the system clean up after a failed
	admin connection (same code as closing an admin connection).

2000-06-07  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* common/game.h: Removed redundant 'VERSION' define in header.
	We have config.h, let's start using it.

2000-06-07  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>

	* client/legend.c (legend_create_dlg): Fixed segfault
	dereferencing NULL game_params before game connection established.
	
2000-06-06  Andy Heroff <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* Changed version number to 0.5.5 to prevent CVS users from using
	  incompatable versions.

2000-06-06  Roderick Schertler <roderick@argon.org>

	* client/resource.c: add a 'total' field to your list of resources.

2000-06-04  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* server/into-the-desert.map, server/greater-catan.map:
	Removed old-style .map files; these have been obsoleted by the
	.game files.

2000-06-01  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* gnocatan.spec: RPM layout fixed up to conform with the rest
	of Gnome packages.

2000-05-30  Bibek Sahu <scorpio@dodds.net>

	* server/gnocatan-server.c: Fixed a minor bug where the game was no
	longer being set to the first one loaded.

2000-05-30  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in, common/map.[ch], server/server.c:
	Added support for new glib g_rand functions.  Untested.

2000-05-28  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>

	* client/client.c (mode_start): Goto mode_offline after
	sm_pop_all(), prevents stack underflow.
	
2000-05-28  Bibek Sahu <scorpio@dodds.net>
	* client/Makefile.am client/gui.c client/gui.h client/admin-gtk.c
	server/gnocatan-server.c: Added a basic network administration 
	interface (stole the interface from the gtk server).  Needs work.

2000-05-27  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* common/map.c, server/server.c: Converted common/map.c to use the
	Mersenne Twister PRNG; further tweaks in g_rand() (non)support.

	* server/mt_rand.[ch], server/Makefile.am, common/mt_rand.[ch],
	common/Makefile.am: Moved Mersenne Twister to the common/ subdir,
	as it's needed elsewhere.

2000-05-27  Andy Heroff <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* client/gui.c: Added total functionality to what is in the settings
	  dialog. What's there works. More settings will be added as needed.

	* server/.cvsignore: Readded gnocatan-server to the ignore list for
	  now for those with dirty build directories. Will remove later.

2000-05-27  Bibek Sahu <scorpio@dodds.net>

	* server/gnocatan-server.c: added a little debugging output.  Will
	be useful soon for network configuration.

	* server/Makefile.am, server/gnocatan-server.c,
	server/gnocatan-server.h, server/gnocatan-server-gtk.c,
	server/gnocatan-server-console.c: Made as much code as possible
	common between the two servers.  Added rudimentary network
	administration functions.

	* server/server.c: separated networking code from player connection
	code so I could use it elsewhere w/o having to rewrite it.

	* server/Makefile.am: removed line where console server was being
	linked against common gtk code.

2000-05-27  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* server/server.c, server/mt_rand.[ch], server/Makefile.am,
	configure.in: Switched to using the Mersenne Twister for our
	PRNG; should give better dice rolls.

2000-05-25  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* configure.in, acconfig.h: Set up for the use of glib's grand()
	function as a better PRNG.

	* client/client.c: Squashed that nasty robber bug.  If it comes
	back to life, we know it's a roach.

2000-05-22  Andy Heroff <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* server/buildutils.c: Removed longest road debug define to prevent
	spamming the server's console. The debug code is still in there.

	* client/gui.c: Built a settings dialog. It only has one setting,
	and it doesn't work yet. That's next.

2000-05-22  Roderick Schertler <roderick@argon.org>

	* client/player.c: Added player's total victory points to the stat
	window

	* common/network.c: Fixed name resolution code to honor hostnames
	that begin with a digit

2000-05-18  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* server/gnocatan-server-console.c: Plugged in getopt() support so
	that the user has (some) control over the game settings in the
	console server.  Documentation later.

2000-05-17  Bibek Sahu <scorpio@dodds.net>

	* server/gnocatan-server-console.c: removed game_list_item_t
	structure.  The params structure stores a title, so just use that
	instead.  Original filename is not all that relevant; if it becomes
	relevant, we can add it to GameParams later.  Also added a function
	to lookup parameters by title.  Changed hash table to store/lookup
	by string, rather than pointer address.

2000-05-17  Bibek Sahu <scorpio@dodds.net>

	* server/gnocatan-server-console.c: filled in global variables, and 
	added a function to stuff all the game types in a hash.  This will
	be relevant later when it can be changed over the network.
	----> Made the console-only server work. :-)

2000-05-17  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* common/driver.c, server/glib-driver.c: Finished moving glib
	driver to the common/ subdirectory.

	* common/common_gtk.c: Removed gdk-dependent input functions.

	* server/gnocatan-server-console.c: Moved some initialization code
	for the console server's UI driver into the main loop.

	* server/server.h: Polished the include list to eliminate redundancies.

	* common/Makefile.am: Added common_glib.c, common_glib.h to file list.

	* common/common_glib.[ch]:  Added generic glib driver for common
	code.

	* common/driver.h: Fixed prototypes within the UI driver to use
	guint in place of gint.

	* common/common_gtk.h: Changed __common_gui_h to __common_gtk_h.

	* server/glib-driver.c: Used the G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT define in
	place of constant as argument.

2000-05-17  Bibek Sahu <scorpio@dodds.net>

	* server/Makefile.am: Added glib-driver.c and glib-driver.h, which
	are used by the console server.

	* server/glib-driver.[ch]: Functions necessary for the console
	server.
	
	* server/gnocatan-server-console.c: Added some muscle to the
	skeleton: Implemented some of the stuff necessary for a console
	server.

	* server/server.h: Added some headers that it depended on, so it
	didn't scream at me when I tried to include it just for the Player
	structure.

2000-05-17  Bibek Sahu <scorpio@dodds.net>

	* configure.in: added GLIB configuration.

	* common/common_gtk.c, common/driver.h: Added hooks for input
	read/write callbacks and [server] player update callbacks.
	Actually put the input read/write callbacks into
	common/common_gtk.c.
	
	* common/network.c, server/server.c: Switched to using driver's
	input read/write callbacks.

	* server/server.c, server/player.c: Switched to using driver's
	player update callbacks.

	* server/Makefile.am: Added preliminary files for gui-less server.
	
	* server/gnocatan-server.c: Connect the server player-update
	functions.
	
	* server/gnocatan-server-console.c: Preliminary skeleton code for
	gui-less server.
	
2000-05-15  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* client/connect.c: Set reasonable defaults for the connect dialog
	if there isn't a saved config (shuts up GTK, too).

	* common/Makefile.am, client/Makefile.am, server/Makefile.am:
	Changed library name from libgnocatan_gui.a to libgnocatan_gtk.a,
	allowing for the possibility of multiple front-ends

2000-05-13  Bibek Sahu <scorpio@dodds.net>

	* common/driver.[ch], client/gnocatan.c, server/gnocatan-server.c:
	Moved the global driver definition to driver.c, and added a function
	set_ui_driver( UIDriver* ).  Moved logging into the driver
	structure.  Note that the gtk driver starts by logging to the
	console and must be told to move that to a window later on.

2000-05-12  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* common/common_gtk.c, common/state.c: Pulled all GTK-specific code
	out of state.c, moving it to common_gtk.c.

	* client/gnocatan.c, server/gnocatan-server.c: Changed main() loops
	to initialize an appropriate UIDriver.

	* common/state.h: Exported [inc,dec]_use_count() so that they're
	available to the interface drivers.

	* common/driver.h, common/game.h, common/state.h: Fixed some
	header files so that they automatically include headers on which
	they depend, instead of expecting the c file to take care of it all.

	* common/driver.h, common_gtk.h: Began creating the structure for
	independent interface drivers (GTK, console).

2000-05-12  Bibek Sahu <scorpio@dodds.net>

	* common/common_gui.[ch], common/common_gtk.[ch]: Renamed
	common/common_gui.[ch] -> common/common_gtk.[ch] per Steve's
	request.  More appropriate, considering its function.

2000-05-12  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* common/state.[ch], server/buildutil.c, server/develop.c,
	server/discard.c, server/meta.c, server/player.c, server/pregame.c,
	server/resource.c, server/robber.c, server/server.c, server/trade.c,
	server/turn.c:  Made the 'widget' within the StateMachine an opaque
	pointer, so that code that depends on the StateMachine is not bound
	to any one GUI.

	* configure.in, meta-server/gnocatan-meta-server.c:
	Included autoconf fix for cross-platform getopt support

2000-05-12  Bibek Sahu <scorpio@dodds.net>

	* Moved the common gui stuff into a separate library, so a non-gui 
	program won't depend on the gui functions.

2000-05-12  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>

	* client/client.c, common/state.c, common/state.h,
	server/develop.c, server/discard.c, server/player.c,
	server/pregame.c, server/robber.c, server/trade.c, server/turn.c:
	Removed all of the sm_resp_{ok,err,handler}() API from the state
	machine.  Simplified each entry on the state stack down to a
	single StateFunc.  Modified client state machine to use simplified
	state machine API.

	* client/client.c, client/trade.c, client/turn.c: Fixed (untested)
	bug where could not trade after playing road building card before
	rolling dice.  Altered is_maritime_trade_allowed() to look at the
	strict_trade flag.

2000-05-12  Bibek Sahu <scorpio@dodds.net>

	* Completely rewrote logging setup.  It's now very modular in
	design, and the main logging stuff does not depend on gtk/gnome
	(which is the reason it was done).  Most files that did logging were
	moderately modified -- the following functions were converted:
		log_error(...) -> log_message( MSG_ERROR, ... )
		log_info(...) -> log_message( MSG_INFO, ... )
		log_color(...) -> log_message( MSG_CHAT, ... )
	
	* The client's initialization sequence now logs to the console until
	all the windows are set up, then switches logging to the message
	window.  This is step 1 on the road to a server that doesn't require
	a gui...

2000-05-11  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>

	* client/client.c, common/state.[ch]: Removed all of the resphook
	from the state machine API code and replaced it with some wrappers
	to sm_resp_{ok,err,handler}() in client.c.  First stage in
	reducing the client state machine complexity.  Moved a lot of code
	around in client.c in an effort to partition the functionality so
	the stack overflow bug can be found.
	
2000-05-10  Steve Langasek <vorlon@dodds.net>

	* common/buildrec.c, common/cards.c, common/cost.c, common/game.c,

	server/meta.c, server/player.c, server/pregame.c, server/resource.c,
	server/robber.c, server/server.c, server/trade.c, server/turn.c:
	Removed <gnome.h> includes where they aren't necessary, to ease the
	transition to a gui-less or gtk-only server.

	* common/log.h: Internationalization definitions handled internally,
	so we don't have to include <gnome.h> to get them.

2000-05-08  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>

	* common/map.h: Changed the visited attribute in Edge and Node to
	gint for new longest road algorithm.

	* common/map_query.c: Implemented new longest road algorithm which
	can handle edge cycles.
	
	* server/develop.c: Fixed "ERR wrong-plenty" bug.  Was using
	variable before it received a value in resource_available().
	
2000-05-07  Andy Heroff <aheroff@mediaone.net>

	* common/log.c, common/log.h: Added log to console if use_console
	  boolean is set by call to log_set_use_console_bool().

1999-12-22  Dan Egnor <egnor@ofb.net>

	* server/STATES: Attempt at documenting the server state machine.

	* server/trade.c: Fixed? a possible trade race condition.  Actually, 
	the fix was already there, I just think it wasn't quite right, since 
	it didn't reset the player's state properly.  This should be reviewed.

	* server/5-6-player.game: New game file for 5/6 player expansion 
	(from tlau@cs.washington.edu).

	* client/turn.c, server/trade.c: Implemented option to remove 
	build/trade order restriction, as per 5/6 player expansion rules 
	(from tlau@cs.washington.edu).

	* server/gnocatan-server.c, meta-server/gnocatan-meta-server.c:
	Portability fixes (e.g. for Solaris).

	* client/Makefile.am, meta-server/Makefile.am, server/Makefile.am:
	Removed silly setgid "games" from install target.

	* client/help/C/gnocatan.sgml: Fixed some errors in the SGML help-file 
	source.  (Too bad this help file is getting out of date anyway...)

	* macros/Makefile.in: removed from CVS, since it's generated.

1999-12-16  Dan Egnor <egnor@ofb.net>

	* Fixed bug which prevented anyone who didn't build a ship during setup
	from building a ship later (the check to see if the user was out of ships
	was incorrect).

	* "make dist" works now, and has the right version number.

	* Fixed bug #2 (the "domestic-trade delete" bug).

	* Added .cvsignore files to kill those pesky ?'s.

	* client/player.c: Beep when it's your turn.  Is this a good idea?
	I know I'm often distracted and don't notice when my turn comes up.
	It should probably be an option, but I hate to get into the business
	of having "gnocatan preferences"...

	* server/gnocatan-server.c: Fix some problems with the terrain
	randomization toggle; clean up (?) the UI enable/disable logic some
	(the UI is now fully disabled when you start a game).

	* server/seafarers.game: Added chit placement numbers to the tiles.
	Without this, there are no chits, which makes this map a little less
	useful.  I'm pretty sure the numbers aren't in the right places
	(there are lots of neighboring 8's and such); I'll get out our copy 
	of Seafarers and do the right thing at some point.  At least this way 
	we can start testing. 

	* server/server.c: setsockopt(SO_REUSEADDR) *before* bind().

1999-12-16  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>

	* client/gui.c: Added gui_set_game_params() to notify gui code
	when map is available, and to pass game parameters.  Hide toolbar
	buttons that are not used in the game.

	* client/identity.c: Do not display shapes that are not used in
	the game.
	
1999-11-20  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>

	* client/guimap.c: Replaced all of the bogus hand building of
	ships, roads, settlements and cities with a single shape for each
	which is scaled and rotated as required.

	* client/chat.c: Small code reformat.
	
1999-09-04  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>

	* gnocatan.spec, debian/gnocatan-server.files,
	server/Makefile.am, server/small.game: Added small.game.

	* server/gnocatan-server.c (build_interface): Call
	load_game_types() to after creating all widgets.

	* client/trade.c, common/game.c, common/game.h,
	server/default.game, seafarers.game, server/trade.c,
	server/turn.c: Added domestic_trade flag to allow domestic trading
	to be disabled for in a game.  When disabled, the domestic trading
	GUI is not shown.

	* server/robber.c (mode_place_robber): Fixed core dump in games
	where the robber is not initially displayed (small.game).

	* client/client.c, client/client.h, client/develop.c: Dynamically
	allocate the development card deck when the game parameters have
	been received from the server.  Fixes bug where
	DevelDeck.max_cards was not being initialised for player.

	* server/develop.c, server/player.c, server/server.h: Dynamically
	allocate the development card deck for each player when allocated.
	Fixes bug where DevelDeck.max_cards was not being initialised for
	player.
	
1999-09-03  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>

	* common/game.[ch]: Added params_copy() to create an independant
	copy of a GameParams structure.

	server/server.h, server/trade.c, server/turn.c: Changed
	game->params into a pointer to a copy of the GameParams loaded
	from the game file.  This enables the map to be reinitialised
	properly on game restart.  Removed unused game->map and use
	game->params->map instead.

	* common/map.c (layout_chits): Fixed bug which assumed that the
	number of terrain hexes equaled the number of chits in the layout
	sequence.

	* README: Updated version number to 0.4.0

	* gnocatan.spec, client/Makefile.am, server/Makefile.am,
	debian/changelog, debian/control, debian/gnocatan-server.files:

	client/setup.c, common/buildrec.c, common/map_query.c,
	server/buildutil.c, server/pregame.c, server/robber.c,
	server/turn.c, common/game.h, common/map.h, server/server.h:
	Removed EdgeType and Building enums, expanded BuildType enum to
	describe all types of building.  Renamed Node.building to
	Node.type to be consistent with Edge.type.

	* client/guimap.c: Deleted find_ship(), build_ship_regions() as
	they were identical to find_road(), build_road_regions().  Renamed
	find_road(), build_road_regions() to find_edge(),
	build_edge_regions().

	* client/player.[ch], client/quote.c, client/trade.c: Replaced

	* common/Makefile.am: Added game.c.

	* common/buildrec.c (ship_has_place_for_settlement): Added check
	is_node_on_land().  Fixed formatting of a lot of code.

	* common/buildrec.h, common/map.h: Moved enum BuildType, enum
	Terrain, enum Resources to common/map.h

	* common/game.h: Removed NUM_DEVELOP.  Expanded GameParams to make
	all previously static game parameters dynamic.  Added params_*()
	functions to encapsulate GameParams loading / saving / parsing.
	
	* server/develop.c, server/server.h: Replaced static description
	of development card deck with dynamic description from
	game_params.

	* common/map.[ch]: Removed static chat_values[] chit layout
	sequence and replaced it with dynamically defined sequence in
	GameParams.  Added map_set_chits() to bind a chit sequence to a
	map.

	* server/buildutil.c, server/player.c, server/turn.c: Made
	player->num_* count the number of each type that the player has
	built, instead of store the number of each type the player has
	left to build.

	* server/gnocatan-server.c: Almost completely reworked GUI
	handling code.

	* server/pregame.c: Removed send_game_map() as this task is now
	performed during GameParam transfer.

1999-06-29  JT <jtraub@dragoncat.net>

	* server/*.c: Made sure the server reset features were correct.

1999-06-16  JT <jtraub@dragoncat.net>

	* server/server.c (close_player): Fixed bug where server was
	reporting to the meta-server, players leaving the game who had
	never joined it.  It was possible to make the meta-server report
	-ve player counts.
	
1999-06-08  Dave Cole <dave@dccs.com.au>

	* Released 0.3.3
	
	* client/help/C/gnocatan.sgml: Updated help to include description

	domestic trade list.
	
	* client/guimap.[ch] (load_pixmap): Made function global and added
	mask parameter to return pixmap mask from
	gdk_imlib_load_file_to_pixmap().

	* client/player.c (player_set_name): When changing player name,
	report player by previous name when possible.

	* client/quote.c (quote_finish): Do not clear quote_list, as we
	need to be able to interpret quotes accepted even after we have
	rejected domestic trade.

	* client/quote.c (add_reject_row, remove_reject_rows): Pasted
	these functions from trade.c.  Should clean up trading code for
	0.4.x.

	* client/trade.c (quote_trade_call, quote_trade_reject): Add
	player rejected trade row to indicate that other players are
	rejecting domestic trade.

	* client/quote.c (quote_trade_accept): Monitor domestic trade
	activity even after we have rejected trade.  This allows us to
	maintain correct resource counts in the player summary.

	* client/trade.c (is_good_quote, load_pixmaps,
	check_domestic_trades, trade_domestic_quote): Added pixmaps for
	tick and cross to indicate validity of each quote from other
