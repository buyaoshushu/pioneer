 - The meta server should be somehow configurable to:
    - start only a certain max. number of servers on the local machine
    - if this number is reached, start servers on other machines
      (maybe with a proxy meta server running there, or via ssh)
      [Done]
    - be able to restrict access in some forms, maybe based on host
      name and/or IP, and permission to request running server data
      and start new servers

 - Maybe implement ranking of players somehow: In a user's home dir,
   the client could record how often this player won a game, was
   second (point-wise), and so on... The server could collect these
   data on game start, update it at the end and show some statistics.
