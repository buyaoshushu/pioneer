Short guide to install Gnocatan in Cygwin

Install a minimal setup
=======================
1) Get 'setup.exe' from the Cygwin site (www.cygwin.com)
2) Let it run once without selection additional packages,
   to install the base system
3) Start the Cygwin shell, to verify the base install works, and
   to create the default settings
4) Exit the shell ('exit')
5) Start the setup program again, and select:
   Category Gnome:
      libgnomeui2
      libxml2-devel
   Category Graphics:
      jpeg
   Category X11:
      xorg-x11-f100
      xorg-x11-fsrv
      xorg-fscl
6) Start the setup program for the third time, and select:
   Category Devel:
      ORBit2-devel
      atk-devel
      gcc
      gtk-x11-devel
      intltool
      libXft-devel
      libbonobo2-devel
      libesound-devel
      libtool-devel
      make
      openssl-devel
      pango-devel
      pkg-config
You now have a minimal setup needed to build and run Gnocatan.

I had to start the installation program three times, because I had 
problems downloading some packages.

4) Enter the source directory (cd gnocatan-%versionnumber%)
5) Configure, build and install

     make
     make install
